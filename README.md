- Total number of rows in data: 119390
- Total number of columns: 32
```

## Data Cleaning


### (1) Removing duplicate rows if any
```
All duplicate rows were dropped.
```
### (2) Handling missing values
```
- Null values in columns 'company','agent', 'country' and 'children' were replaced by 0.
- There are some rows with total number of 'adults' , 'children' and 'babies' is equal to zero. So we will remove such rows is equal 0.
```

### (3) Converting columns to appropriate data types
```
- Changed data type of `children`, `company`, `agent` float to int type.
- Changed data type of 'reservation_status_date' to datetime format.
```

### (5) Adding important columns
```
- Creating new column `Total_stay_in_nights` by adding `stays_in_weekend_nights`+`stays_in_week_nights`.
- Creating new column `Total_people` by adding `adults`+`children`+`babies`.
```

## Analysis:

Performed analysis and made following conclusions:
```
1. A city hotel has more bookings than a resort. Offer packages and promotions to promote bookings for the resort hotel.

2. BB is the most requested food. The hotel should maintain food quality while also offering discounts on other foods to promote other food types, reducing the burden on kitchen management and keeping a variety of food options available to customers.

3. Most of the bookings are made through the online platform. Hotels can cut costs by eliminating market segments such as complementary and aviation because bookings through these segments are very low.

4. Because most bookings made through TA/TO distribution are followed by corporate distribution, hotels should invest in both TA/TO and corporate distribution channels. The GDS distribution channel can be eliminated by hoteliers because bookings made through it are extremely low.

5. Very few customers (4%) visited again. So hotels can increase repeat bookings by offering the right repeat booking incentives, understanding the motivations behind repeat bookings, marketing to your guests’ past interests, and assessing past bookings to identify priority guests.

6. Because rooms A and D are the most popular with customers, the hotel should maintain their quality. The hotel should promote rooms E, F, and G to increase demand by offering discounts. Because customers do not prefer to book room types B, C, H, and L, the hotel can eliminate them, lowering the cost of these rooms.

7. People typically book rooms for two people, so encourage family and group bookings. You can maximize revenue by promoting it with a discounted offer for group bookings.

## Conclusion

```
(1). The majority of guests come from western europe countries.We should spend a significant amount of our budget on those area.

(2). Around 61% bookings are for City hotel and 39% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel.

(3). Majority of the hotels booked are city hotel. Definitely need to spend the most targeting fund on those hotel.

(4). We should also target months between May to Aug. Those are peak months due to the summer period.

(5). Given that we do not have repeated guests, we should target our advertisement on guests to increase returning guests.
approax 80% distribution_channel is TA/TO

(6). Most common stay length is less than 4 days and generally people prefer City hotel for short stay, but for long stays, Resort Hotel is preferred.

(7). November,Descember, February And January are the months which has less booking so in this perios you can get rooms with less average daily rate. And Avoid most busiest months for hotels (June,July,August)
